<!--
**haleypandya/haleypandya** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in my fourth year at McMaster University taking the CHEM 3PA3 Quantum Mechanic and Spec course which has finally introduced me to GitHub!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code using Google Colab. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love skidiving! 
- My favourite hobby is dancing!
